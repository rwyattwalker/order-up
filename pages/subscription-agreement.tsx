Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, Confidential Information does not include information which: (a) is or becomes public knowledge without any action by, or involvement of, the Party to which the Confidential Information is disclosed (the &ldquo;Receiving Party&rdquo;); (b) is documented as being known to the Receiving Party prior to its disclosure by the other Party (the &ldquo;Disclosing Party&rdquo;); (c) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without reference or access to the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party and is so documented; or (d) is obtained by the Receiving Party without restrictions on use or disclosure from a third party. 8.2 Confidentiality Obligations At all times, the Receiving Party will protect and preserve the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party as confidential, using no less care than that with which it protects and preserves its own confidential and proprietary information (but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care), and will not use the Confidential Information for any purpose except to perform its obligations and exercise its rights under this Agreement. The Receiving Party may disclose, distribute, or disseminate the Disclosing Party&rsquo;s Confidential Information to any of its officers, directors, members, managers, partners, employees, contractors, or agents (its &ldquo;Representatives&rdquo;), provided that the Receiving Party reasonably believes that its Representatives have a need to know and such Representatives are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those contained herein.

The Receiving Party will at all times remain responsible for any violations of this Agreement by any of its Representatives. If the Receiving Party is legally compelled to disclose any of the Disclosing Party&rsquo;s Confidential Information, the Receiving Party will provide the Disclosing Party prompt prior written notice of such requirement so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the terms of this Section. If such protective order or other remedy is not obtained or the Disclosing Party waives compliance with the provisions of this Section, the Receiving Party may furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which it is advised by its counsel is legally required to be disclosed, and will use its best efforts to insure that confidential treatment will be afforded such disclosed portion of the Confidential Information. 9.
